I had the opportunity to run my first ever adventure club on the [Party Corgi Network Discord server](https://discord.gg/partycorgi) recently and I wanted to write down some things I learned from my experience!

My adventure club was a bit different than most of the other clubs that have sprung to life in the PCN, my adventure club was about having adventures. We did a Dungeons and Dragons focused group of some one-shot adventures.

## TL;DR

I had a great time running an adventure club and it's something I want to do more of in the future. I should have invested more time upfront making sure I knew what everyone wanted to get out of the group and I should have found more ways to incorporate their backstories into our little adventures.
